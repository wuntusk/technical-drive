# Technical Drive

Copies of my book I published in 1997 on the internals of the TI-99/4A peripherals.

One is the original scan. The other has been OCR'd so you can search/cut/paste and all that.

It was [this project](https://github.com/jambuur/APEDSK99) that got me inspired to get it scanned and ocr'd.

Enjoy
